      "title": "Scientific Explanation",
      "content": "The science behind the Northern Lights is as captivating as the lights themselves. Picture this: charged particles from the Sun embark on a journey across space, carried by the solar wind. When these energetic particles reach Earth, they collide with atoms and molecules in our atmosphere. These collisions, though invisible to the naked eye, create a spectacular light show that dances across the sky. The specific colors of the aurora depend on the type of gas involved in the collisions – green from oxygen at lower altitudes, red from oxygen at higher altitudes, and blue and purple from nitrogen. It’s like the cosmos painting with a palette of light.",
